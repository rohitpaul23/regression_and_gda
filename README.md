Implementing few concepts from machine learning from scratch
1. Implement least squares linear regression to predict density of wine based on its acidity.
2. Introducing the idea of Sampling by adding Gaussian noise to the prediction of a hypothesis and generate synthetic training data.
3. Use the SGD algorithm to learn the original hypothesis from the data generated using sampling, for varying batch sizes.
5. Implementing Newton’s method for optimizing L(θ), and applying it to fit a logistic regression model to the data.
6. Implementing GDA for separating out salmons from Alaska and Canada. Each salmon is represented by two attributes x1 and x2 depicting growth 
ring diameters in fresh water, and marine water, respectively.
